                <p> Wait, hold on. Your job as a TA is to make sure that all of
                    your students are getting the most out of the class. You
                    might as well ask her if she has any questions. </p>

                    questions and so didn't want to sign up. How does this
                    method work again?</p>
                <p> "That's not a bad question at all! I had the same one." you
                    say. <i>You describe to her how the method works.</i> </p>
                <p> Thanks! That was really helpful. I guess I'll sign up for
                    hours the next time I don't know how to do something </p>

                    she has a question. </p>

            You wake up again, finding yourself in the lobby of the CIT.
